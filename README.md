# Railway-Simulator
A simple railway simulator that allows you to change the way the railway <br />
is connected by removing the connections and adding new ones to the <br />
network. <div> The properties of the railroad cars that are attached <br />
to the train sets could be changed, you could attach new ones, remove them and track their properties and health. <br />
<div> With time, the railroad cars will deteriorate with random consequences. If deterioration <br />
reaches its maximum, the railroad car will be destroyed and a new one will be attached 
automatically.
<div> <br />The railway network is based on a Minimum Spanning Tree with bidirectional graph nodes. <br />
The map is 1000 by 1000 kilometers. <br />
